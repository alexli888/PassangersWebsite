    <h4>Hibernation Pods:</h4>
    <p> The spaceship in the movie, the Starship Avalon, uses advanced hibernation pods that allow passengers to sleep for extended periods during the long journey through space. These pods are equipped with advanced life support and monitoring systems to ensure the safety of the passengers while in hibernation. Relating to real life, hibernation pods are a real thing in development by the European Space Agency. These pods reduce the metabolic rate of a crew en route to Mars down to 25% of the normal state, dramatically reducing the number of supplies and habitat size, and making long-duration exploration more feasible. The computing device used for such hibernation mimics therapeutic torpor, which is the idea of putting humans into a state of hibernation by inducing hypothermia to reduce metabolism. The details on how to estate hibernation in the movie is to Stabilize And Suspend, which stops all metabolic activity, which is scientifically impossible, but this is a sci-fi movie [14].</p>

    <h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI) System:</h4>
    <p>The Avalon in "Passengers" is managed by an advanced AI system responsible for various ship functions and passenger interactions. Arthur, the bartender AI, showcases a realistic aspect of technology, as current robot bartenders can create drinks based on a person's mood [6]. However, the portrayal of an advanced AI system controlling the entire ship might be a stretch, considering the current limitations in AI automation seen in areas like automobile controls and spaceship operations.</p>

    <h4>Entertainment Systems:</h4>
    <p>Passengers on the Avalon have access to advanced entertainment systems, including virtual reality experiences and interactive media such as basketball with animations. These systems provide entertainment and relaxation during the long voyage. Relating to real life, MIT Sloan reports generative AI is already being used in entertainment in ways such as writing scripts for movies and producing movies such as the 2022 film Everything Everywhere All at Once. At the time of this movie's filming, such tech was a stretch, but nowadays, this computing technology is realistic and likely exists somewhere [2]. </p>

    <h4>Autodoc:</h4>
    <p>The futuristic healthcare technology depicted in "Passengers," such as the Autodoc, is indeed quite advanced and not currently achievable in real life. While we have made significant progress in medical technology with devices like electrocardiographs, X-ray machines, and CAT scanners, the comprehensive capabilities of the Autodoc in diagnosing and treating various diseases within a compact machine remain fictional for now [3].</p>

    <h4>Spacesuit:</h4>
    <p>The spacesuits in "Passengers" showcase futuristic features like magnetic boots for attaching to the spaceship and tethers that click on magnetically at different spots inside the spacecraft. The spacesuit also features a heads-up display, which shows the name of the wearer of the spacesuit, as well as vitals and a scope to a target location. While the magnetic boots' capabilities seem realistic, there's a discrepancy with NASA's recommendation to avoid using magnets in tethers due to the risk of attracting harmful contamination like space debris. According to NASA guidelines, magnets can collect such debris, making them impractical for use in space tethers [4]. As for the heads-up display, this form of computing technology is already in place in modern-day spacesuits, as cited from NASA [15].

    <h4>Communication Systems:</h4>
    <p>The communication systems aboard the Avalon in "Passengers" facilitate connections with Earth, which takes 19 years for a 1-way message to be delivered. However, this portrayal stretches reality as current communication technologies heavily rely on satellites. Given the vast distance of the Avalon from Earth and other planets, maintaining satellites in orbit would be impractical due to the lack of gravitational forces to keep them in place, as noted in a NASA article [5].

    <h4>Cleaner Robots:</h4>
    <p>The cleaner robots aboard the Avalon are vital for maintaining cleanliness and sanitation in the dining room. However, they face challenges as depicted in the movie, with instances of continuous collisions with walls and even falling down floor levels, showcasing their occasional failures.The cleaner robots on the Avalon reflect realistic technology seen in today's products like Roomba autonomous vacuum cleaners. These robots can clean floors thoroughly, including under furniture and along walls, and they use advanced sensors and software to navigate cluttered spaces and decide where to vacuum [7]. However, similar to Roombas, they also face limitations, such as occasionally bumping into obstacles like walls due to sensor issues or chip defects [8].</p>

    <h4>Information Kiosks:</h4>
    <p>On the Avalon, there are Information Kiosks situated at the Grand Concourse Level, offering digital access to details about the ship. However, in the movie, these kiosks are depicted as having very limited information, which can be frustrating for users seeking more comprehensive details. The information kiosks onboard the Avalon mirror realistic technology seen today, such as mall kiosks or airport information stations, which offer details about the building and available resources. This similarity highlights how the information kiosks in the movie resemble modern-day digital kiosks [9].</p>

    <h4>Artificial Gravity:</h4>
    <p>On the Avalon, the ship has a computer-controlled artificial gravity system. This artificial gravity system shows the failure of a complete shutdown in later parts of the movie. This technology is similar to technology seen today. A patent from NASA shows the capability of generating artificial gravity in spaceships (TOP2-311); however, despite this technology being possible, it has yet to be implemented in modern-day spaceships or space stations [10].

        <h4>Holographic Tablets:</h4>
        <p>Holographic tablets with many functions, aka writing and info manual
            Passengers on the Avalon have holographic tablets with many functions, such as writing books in Aurora’s case and looking at information manuals in Jim’s Case. This type of technology is feasible, but an interview from Sony suggests that this technology was quite advanced in 2016. Given the pace of technology development, Sony Engineers predict that such technologies can be developed in the near future [11].

            <p>In the hibernation pods and rooms aboard the Avalon, we constantly see a hologram woman displaying human interactions, such as greeting the passengers and responding to questions by the passengers. This technology is feasible and is already released today. A report from the Economic Times reports of a portable hologram machine that lets you talk in real-time with a hologram person [12].

                <h4>Diagnostic System: </h4>
                <p>On the Avalon, the ship has an advanced diagnostic system, with 16 tech stations on each deck to monitor ship functions. This diagnostic system is exclusively used by the crew of the ship, requiring authentication to access the system. This type of technology is a sci-fi take on the technology that is currently out in the form of NASA Patents. The NASA Patent (KSC-TOPS-30) is a multidimensional system for detecting damage to surfaces and vessels [13], which is very similar to what the movie portrays, except that the movie is a hologram image.
