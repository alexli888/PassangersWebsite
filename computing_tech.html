    <h4>Hibernation Pods:</h4>
    <p> The spaceship in the movie, the Starship Avalon, uses advanced hibernation pods that allow passengers to sleep for extended periods during the long journey through space. These pods are equipped with advanced life support and monitoring systems to ensure the safety of the passengers while in hibernation. Relating to real life, hibernation pods are a real thing in development by the European Space Agency. These pods reduce the metabolic rate of a crew en route to Mars down to 25% of the normal state would dramatically cut down the number of supplies and habitat size, making long-duration exploration more feasible [1].</p>

    <h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI) System:</h4>
    <p>The Avalon in "Passengers" is managed by an advanced AI system responsible for various ship functions and passenger interactions. Arthur, the bartender AI, showcases a realistic aspect of technology, as current robot bartenders can create drinks based on a person's mood [6]. However, the portrayal of an advanced AI system controlling the entire ship might be a stretch, considering the current limitations in AI automation seen in areas like automobile controls and spaceship operations.</p>

    <h4>Entertainment Systems:</h4>
    <p>Passengers on the Avalon have access to advanced entertainment systems, including virtual reality experiences and interactive media. These systems provide entertainment and relaxation during the long voyage. Relating to real life, MIT Sloan reports generative AI is being used in entertainment already in ways such as writing scripts for movies and producing movies such as the 2022 file Everything Everywhere All at Once. At the time of this movie's filming, such tech was a stretch, but nowadays, this computing technology is realistic and likely exists somewhere [2]. </p>

    <h4>Autodoc:</h4>
    <p>The futuristic healthcare technology depicted in "Passengers," such as the Autodoc, is indeed quite advanced and not currently achievable in real life. While we have made significant progress in medical technology with devices like electrocardiographs, X-ray machines, and CAT scanners, the comprehensive capabilities of the Autodoc in diagnosing and treating various diseases within a compact machine remain fictional for now [3].</p>

    <h4>Spacesuit:</h4>
    <p>The spacesuits in "Passengers" showcase futuristic features like magnetic boots for attaching to the spaceship and tethers that click on magnetically at different spots inside the spacecraft. While these capabilities seem realistic, there's a discrepancy with NASA's recommendation to avoid using magnets in tethers due to the risk of attracting harmful contamination like space debris. Magnets can collect such debris, making them impractical for use in space tethers according to NASA guidelines [4].

    <h4>Communication Systems:</h4>
    <p>The communication systems aboard the Avalon in "Passengers" facilitate real-time connections with Earth and other distant parts of the galaxy. However, this portrayal stretches reality as current communication technologies heavily rely on satellites. Given the vast distance of the Avalon from Earth and other planets, maintaining satellites in orbit would be impractical due to the lack of gravitational forces to keep them in place, as noted in a NASA article [5].</p>

    <h4>Cleaner Robots:</h4>
    <p>The cleaner robots aboard the Avalon are vital for maintaining cleanliness and sanitation in the dining room. However, they face challenges as depicted in the movie, with instances of continuous collisions with walls and even falling down floor levels, showcasing their occasional failures.The cleaner robots on the Avalon reflect realistic technology seen in today's products like Roomba autonomous vacuum cleaners. These robots can clean floors thoroughly, including under furniture and along walls, and they use advanced sensors and software to navigate cluttered spaces and decide where to vacuum [7]. However, similar to Roombas, they also face limitations, such as occasionally bumping into obstacles like walls due to sensor issues or chip defects [8].</p>

    <h4>Information Kiosks:</h4>
    <p>On the Avalon, there are Information Kiosks situated at the Grand Concourse Level, offering digital access to details about the ship. However, in the movie, these kiosks are depicted as having very limited information, which can be frustrating for users seeking more comprehensive details. The information kiosks onboard the Avalon mirror realistic technology seen today, such as mall kiosks or airport information stations, which offer details about the building and available resources. This similarity highlights how the information kiosks in the movie resemble modern-day digital kiosks [9].</p>
