            <p>In the movie, we see automation and job destruction as a theme where automation has reached its peak. Human roles, ranging from bartenders to cleaners, are seamlessly replaced by robotic counterparts and AI-driven systems. This theme underscores the societal impact of automation, where efficiency and convenience come at the cost of traditional job opportunities. For instance, the absence of human involvement in food preparation and delivery, managed entirely by robotic systems, highlights the extent of job displacement in this advanced technological setting.</p>
            <p>The movie also delves into the digital divide enforced by entities like the Homestead Group. This divide manifests as a stark contrast between the information available to passengers and the comprehensive knowledge retained by the controlling entity Homestead. Passengers aboard the Avalon are restricted in their access to crucial information, leading to a sense of ignorance and dependency. This theme resonates with real-world concerns about information control and unequal access to knowledge, highlighting the power dynamics inherent in such scenarios.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, The limited awake population on the spaceship sets the stage for a winner-take-all society, where early access to resources and privileges becomes a significant advantage. Jim, being one of the first to awaken, enjoys unprecedented access to amenities, exclusive areas, and a monopoly over specific resources such as a Gold Class Room, and a plethora of snacks. This theme underscores the unequal distribution of opportunities and rewards in a confined environment, where the first movers can leverage their position for personal gain while others remain unaware, in this case hibernating, or disadvantaged.</p>
            <p>The movie also addresses themes of wasteful consumption within a constrained ecosystem. Jim's reckless indulgence in excess resources, such as food, reflects a disregard for the scarcity and value of these resources. His ability to hoard and consume without immediate consequences highlights a society where abundance can lead to wastefulness, especially when individuals have unchecked access to limited resources. This theme prompts reflection on sustainability and responsible resource management, even in seemingly abundant environments.</p>
