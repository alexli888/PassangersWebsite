        <p>There is no government presence in this movie. As such not covered. One can argue that the Homestead company is the government in a sense, but they don't show any authoritative position in this movie.</p>   
        <p>The government should have more control over the company, if this is a formal colonization, shouldn't the government have some kind of officials to compliment this voyage?  Also as mentioned there is no police or any kind of law enforcement personnel from the government to ensure the safety of the ship. This is a ship in space, and communication from the ship to Earth takes 55 years. What happens if there is a bad person trying to do bad things? If Jim was a bad person and mistakenly woke up early, the entire ship could be in danger. Do all the passengers go through a safety check or something before boarding the ship that is held by the government? It is possible for it to copy an airport, where the safety check is covered by the government, and the plane/spaceship is owned by private companies.</p>
        <p>Does Earth only send a police when they make an emergency call, it's different than maritime since it takes too long for the police to arrive from Earth to the colonized  planet. The most possible action is to have some crew trained for an emergency like the flight attendants on an aircraft. Even if a crew is a police, they are still behind the iron doors sleeping, it is impossible for them to take action in time of emergency since no one will awake them. Overall, given the vast distance in space, current maritime law can’t be directly moved into space.</p>
        <p>However, the government having too much intervention in a private company could also be bad, they can be spying on its customers' information like what the FBI did when the terrorist used an iphone. The ship and the planet(their destination) is a privately owned property of the company, so does the government have the right to put a police officer on that ship or that planet before an emergency happens that needs a law enforcement personnel? It’s basically like putting a police officer in an office where people live and work, it's unusual for such actions to be carried out.</p>
        <p>Plus the ship is in space, so even if there are no law enforcement personnel the criminal can't run away from the ship, and given their status, they are the only people going to a plant, and if a person did do something bad, how should they be punished? Should the destination have the right of judgment, or Earth?</p>
        <p>These themes underscore the intricate nature of space law, which is still in its nascent stages compared to established maritime laws. As humanity advances in space exploration and colonization efforts, the development of comprehensive legal frameworks encompassing governance structures, law enforcement protocols, and mechanisms for dispute resolution will be imperative in navigating the multifaceted challenges inherent in space activities.</p>
